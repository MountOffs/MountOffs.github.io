    <h2>Contribute</h2>
    There are several ways you can contribute to this project at this point:
    <ol>
        <li>The most valuable contribution would be providing recordings of currently unavailable Mount Offs. <br/>Currently archive lists 37 of them, but some are missing.</li>
        <li>The scripts for each mount off needs to be handwritten and it's pretty tedious work. If you wish to help with this, you can read the details <a class="inlineLink" href="scripts.html">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Spread the word!</li>
    </ol>
